There are many tall tales about the way in which hot dogs are made, but the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council is eager to tell the real story. 

1. Specially selected FOOD pieces are cut or ground into smaller pieces and placed in a mixer. 


2. A high-speed, stainless steel chopper blends the FOOD pieces, spices and PLURAL NOUN into a batter. 

3. The batter is pumped and fed into a NOUN. 

4. The hot dog is fully cooked and hard-wood smoked for texture, color and a ADJECTIVE flavor. 

5. The hot dog is then showered in ADJECTIVE PLURAL NOUN. 

6. Finally, the hot dog is VERB PAST TENSE. 

7. Once VERB PAST TENSE, hot dogs are moved to storage coolers and loaded on ADJECTIVE trucks for delivery.
